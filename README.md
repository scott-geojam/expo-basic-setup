# Commenting app
We'd like a very simple mobile app for commenting on a piece of media.

## Requirements
* Built using React Native with Expo (This repo is your basic expo init app)
* Works on both iOS and Android devices
* Provided a simple app allowing a user to comment, edit, delete and like a piece of content.

## Guidance
The goal of this test is for you to demonstrate your experience, abilities and problem solving. We will test your app on real or emulated mobile devices, running Android & iOS.

Use whatever third-party modules you feel are appropriate, but be prepared to justify your choices. No need to create any type of backend database, you can house all the data in files or state on the front end.

Your app should look good & perform smoothly.

## Submission
Please host your submission on GitHub by forking this repository. Let me know when you're happy with it by emailing a link to [scott@geojam.com](mailto:scott@geojam.com; when you do so, please give me an indication of how long you spent on the test.

Have fun!
